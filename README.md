### Session Description

Learn to leverage Microsoft Agent Framework, the new unified platform from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen engineering teams, to build A2A compatible agents similar to magnetic-one. Use SWE Agents (GitHub Copilot coding agent and Codex with Azure OpenAI models) to accelerate development. Implement MCP tools for secure enterprise agentic workflows. Experience hands-on building, deploying, and orchestrating multi-agent systems with pre-release capabilities. Note: Contains embargoed content.

### 📁 Repository

For detailed lab instructions and hands-on exercises, navigate to the [spec-to-agents](https://github.com/microsoft/spec-to-agents) repository. The Skillable related instructions can be found in [lab/instructions](./lab/instructions) directory.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

-  Build A2A (Agent-to-Agent) compatible agents using Microsoft Agent Framework
-  Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for secure enterprise workflows
-  Deploy and orchestrate multi-agent workflows
